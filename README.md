# Doodle-Jump-in-Processing.py
This is a super barebones doodle jump style game written in processing.py. I was inspired to make this after a redditor (/u/FAGINITE) offered to pay me to make it (thanks dude!).

## Usage
To play, clone the repository, and open `DoodleJumpClone.pyde` in the Processing editor. To do this you will need the python mode installed.

## Gameplay
LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys move the bouncing cube left and right. Jump on the platforms to move up. If you die, click the mouse to restart. After a score of 200 platforms might start to disappear when jumped on! After a score of 500 all platforms will disappear once jumped on, so be quick. Good luck!
